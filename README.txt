Password Complexity Checker

Description
This project is part of the Prodigy Cyber Security internship. It implements a password complexity checker in Python, which evaluates the strength of a given password based on specific criteria.

Features
- Evaluates password length.
- Checks for the presence of uppercase letters.
- Checks for the presence of lowercase letters.
- Checks for the presence of numbers.
- Checks for the presence of special characters.
- Classifies passwords as "Strong", "Good", or "Weak".

How It Works

1. User Input: Prompts the user to enter a password.
2. Password Evaluation:
    - Checks if the password is at least 8 characters long.
    - Verifies the presence of at least one uppercase letter.
    - Verifies the presence of at least one lowercase letter.
    - Verifies the presence of at least one number.
    - Verifies the presence of at least one special character.
3. Scoring: Calculates a total score based on the above criteria.
4. Output: Prints the password strength as "Strong", "Good", or "Weak".

Example:
Enter your password: Password123!
Password strength: Strong password

In this example, the password "Password123!" meets all the criteria and is classified as a "Strong password".
